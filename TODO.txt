- Create phpfpm-wordpress container
	- test phpfpm if possible
		- Testing without webserver:
			- apk add fcgi
			- echo -e "SCRIPT_FILENAME=/home/testscript.php\nREQUEST_METHOD=GET\n\n" | cgi-fcgi -bind -connect 127.0.0.1:9000
			- Problem: PHP does not react
			- Solution:
				- enable logs in config file
				- if that does not help move on
				- delete test script after solving
		- Add config file that sets listen to 0.0.0.0
			- better if possible command line settings
	- download wordpress
	- add wpconfig
	- add installation script
	- test (by checking if database has changed)
- Further down the road
    - initialize mariadb at startup
