- Wordpress container
DONE:
- Basic install
- Can talk to mariadb via wordpress
	- Test command: 
		mariadb --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3316 -u wpuser -p
TODO:
- Try to make nginx talk to php-wordpress
	- It looks like the nginx - php communication can only work with a volume
		- Rename /var/www/wordpress to wordpress_src and then copy over in entrypoint script
		- Add volume
		- Test that both containers can access the volume
	- Provide http config file for NGINX





- Further down the road
	- initialize mariadb via entrypoint script
	- Use environment variables
	- Get rid of all the open passwords
	- Add makefile
