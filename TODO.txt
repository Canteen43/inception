- Wordpress container
DONE:
- Basic install
- Can talk to mariadb via wordpress
	- Test command: 
		mariadb --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3316 -u wpuser -p
TODO:
- Make sure it can talk to nginx
	- Determine next step:
		- Start working on forwarding NGINX container?
		- Does simple PHP-Server make sense for testing?
		- Should I use curl to test outside server availability?





- Further down the road
	- initialize mariadb via entrypoint script
	- Use environment variables
	- Get rid of all the open passwords
