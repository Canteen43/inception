- Automate shell script
	- Current shell script is run manually with "sh" CMD
	- Goal: Have it run as CMD (or entrypoint) so that container is fully automatic
	- maybe use "--console" so that it doesn't stop
	(- If several scripts are needed, I can add docker-entrypoint.sh which will run
	everything in /docker-entrypoint.d/)
- Test that MariaDB is reachable
- Add wordpress config to DB
- Integrate into docker compose
