- Test that MariaDB is reachable
Problem: 
    - Login is not allowed for wpuser and I don't know why
        docker run -d -p 3316:3306 --rm mymariadb
        mariadb --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3316 -u wpuser -p
Solution:
    - Go into container with CMD sh and mariadbd & so that I can check user permissions
        - The wpuser is somehow not in the database. Make sure it is
- Add wordpress config to DB
- Integrate into docker compose
