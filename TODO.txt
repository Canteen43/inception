- Use environment variables and get rid of all the open passwords
	- PLAN: use .env file as "env_file" in docker compose for everything
		PROBLEM: wp-config.php seems not to be able to read the variables
		SOLUTION:
			- wordpressinstall works fine with environment variables.
			- reason might be that fastCGI run wp-config


- Add dockerignore?
- Is there a way to make the blog prettier?
- look at restarting containers
- Update README
