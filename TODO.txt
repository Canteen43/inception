- Use environment variables and get rid of all the open passwords
	- research how env works in docker compose
		- PROBLEM: Scope of these environment variables is unclear to me
		- SOLUTION: There are many different methods with different scopes
			- Find out where passwords and usernames are used
				- nginx
					- servername in wordpress_https.conf (buildtime)
				- wordpress-php
					- wordpress username and password in entrypoint.sh (runtime)
					- servername, port (if not standard 443), username, email and password of wordpress admin in wordpressinstall.php (runtime)
					- wordpress username and password in wp-config.php (runtime)
				- mariadb
					- wordpress user and password in entrypoint.sh (runtime)
			- Idea: Work with env_file
				- can be reused for all containers
				- injects environment variables into environment of containers
			- PROBLEM: It seems like .env can be used as env_files which is very confusing
			- SOLUTION: Take a moment to think about it. If nothing becomes clear, start iteratively. 
	- implement env logic


- add special server name
	- name: kweihman.42.fr
	- I edited C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
		- it works
		- should I set to set the port there?
		- add port to wordpressinstall
		- can I use my own 443 port?

- Add dockerignore?
- Is there a way to make the blog prettier?
- Update README
